#Description:
This repository contains the codebase and resources for a mental health-oriented chatbot developed using GPT 3.5 Turbo. The chatbot aims to provide support, information, and resources related to mental health queries. The project focuses on efficient communication, security, and accuracy.

## Features:

* Utilizes GPT 3.5 Turbo for the basic chatbot framework.
* Implements encryption and security measures through a secure vault mechanism to protect API keys. (for now, they are stored in Config.json)
* Adopts a prompt-based engineering method for quicker training and response time.
* Customized prompts guide the chatbot's interactions, a technique known as shot prompting.
* Refines prompts using the Langchain library, incorporating pre-trained language models.
* Optimized indexing and searching algorithms ensure faster and more accurate replies.
* Incorporates Pinecone Vector database for accurate data storage and retrieval.
* Performs precise Cosine similarity searches between user queries and stored documents.
* Uses OpenAI models: text-embedding-ada-002 for text-to-vector conversion, GPT Turbo 3.5 for natural conversations.
* Enhances comprehension of user sentiment and adjusts responses accordingly.
* Ensures moderation and filters out hateful speech for a positive user experience.
* Has multiple API's incorporated to include the service of connecting nearby support centres and emergency services (Detects self harm tones and automatically alerts authorities).
